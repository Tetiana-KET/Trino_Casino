## Task Description

Create a landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following features and requirements:

### Responsive Design

The page should display correctly on all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
The design in Figma includes three specific breakpoints (mobile, tablet, and desktop). The layout should dynamically adapt to any screen width beyond these breakpoints.

### Interactive Wheel of Fortune

Implement an interactive Wheel of Fortune that spins upon clicking a button and randomly stops at one of the three bonus sectors:

300% up to €3000 + 300 FS
330% up to €4000
400 FS on first 4 deposits

**Before spinning**, the three bonus sectors should feature an animated golden glow around their perimeter to highlight their significance. The glow animation should be smooth and visually engaging.

**After spinning**, an animated and colorful pop-up should display the bonus won, with the following structure:

**Messages by Bonus:**
Bonus Pack 300% up to €3000 + 300 FS on first 4 deposits
Button: "Take bonus"
